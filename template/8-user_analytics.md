# User Analytics and Acceptance

## Key Metrics

User Engagement:

- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Session Duration
- Interactions per Session

User Growth:

- New User Acquisition Rate
- User Retention Rate
- User Churn Rate

Feature Adoption:

- Percentage of Users Completing Profile Setup
- Percentage of Users Connecting with Friends
- Percentage of Users Sending Messages
- Percentage of Users Using a Graph View
- Percentage of Users Registering with Google

Event Engagement:

- Event Attendance Rate
- Event Participation Rate
- Event Discovery Rate

## Success Criteria

- **User Engagement:** Achieve a steady increase in DAU and MAU over time, indicating sustained user engagement with the app.
- **User Growth:** Maintain a positive user retention rate and minimize user churn, ensuring continuous growth of the user base.
- **Feature Adoption:** Ensure a high percentage of users complete profile setup and engage with core features such as connecting with friends and sending messages.
- **Event Engagement:** Drive event attendance and participation rates, demonstrating the value of event integration for users.
Analysis Plan:
Data Collection:

Implement analytics tools such as Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics to track user interactions and events within the app.
Collect demographic data, user preferences, and behavioral patterns to gain insights into user behavior.

## Data Analysis

Regularly analyze key metrics to monitor user engagement, growth, and feature adoption.
Conduct cohort analysis to track user retention and churn rates over time.
Perform event-based analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of event integration features.

## A/B Testing

Test different variations of app features, UI/UX elements, and messaging to optimize user engagement and conversion rates. Test different onboarding flows to determine the most effective method for profile setup completion. Experiment with messaging prompts to encourage users to connect with friends or attend events. Test variations of event discovery interfaces to enhance event engagement and participation.

### A/B Testing Ideas: Onboarding Flow Variations

A/B test different onboarding flows, including guided tutorials versus self-exploration, to determine the most effective method for profile setup completion.
Messaging Prompt Variations:

Test variations of in-app messaging prompts to encourage users to connect with friends or initiate conversations, assessing the impact on user engagement and interaction rates.
Event Discovery Interface Variations:

Experiment with different interfaces for event discovery, such as list view versus grid view or filtering options, to enhance event engagement and participation rates among users.

### A/B Testing Ideas: Map View for Events

A/B test the implementation of a map view for event discovery alongside the existing list view. Measure user engagement and event attendance rates to determine which view enhances user experience and increases event participation.

Implement A/B testing for the graph view feature, which visualizes users' social networks. Test variations in the layout algorithm, such as force-directed layout versus hierarchical layout, to evaluate user preference and usability.
Measure user engagement metrics, such as time spent exploring the graph and interactions with nodes, to assess the effectiveness of each layout option.

Analyze A/B test results to determine the optimal layout algorithm for the graph view feature, iterating based on user feedback and usage patterns to improve overall user satisfaction and engagement.
