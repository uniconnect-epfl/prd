## Features Outside the Scope

While UniConnect initially targets university students, expanding the platform's scope to include other educational institutions or professional organizations could be relevant in the future. However, this expansion would require additional resources and considerations beyond the MVP phase.

Incorporating features specifically tailored for dating, such as matchmaking algorithms, profile compatibility assessments, and private messaging for romantic connections, could enhance UniConnect's appeal to users seeking romantic relationships. However, these features would significantly expand the scope and complexity of the platform, making them more suitable for future iterations rather than the MVP.

Offering recruitment services, such as job postings, internships, and career networking opportunities, could provide additional value to users and potentially generate revenue for UniConnect. However, building robust recruitment features requires careful consideration of legal, privacy, and regulatory requirements, making it more suitable for later stages of development.

### Integration Plan
These functionalities could be integrated into future versions of UniConnect once the MVP has been successfully launched and established. Prioritizing simplicity and focus for the MVP allows the team to validate the core value proposition and gain insights from user feedback before considering additional features and expansions. As UniConnect evolves and grows, these functionalities can be explored and implemented in the sequence presented to further enhance the platform's utility and appeal to users.
