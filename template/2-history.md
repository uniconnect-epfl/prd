# History

## Proof of Concept
The Proof of Concept (POC) for UniConnect includes several key features aimed at demonstrating the core functionality of the app. First, it simulates genuine connections by enabling users to add each other as connections via a QR code generated by the app, or through shared interests in announcements. This feature is designed to mimic natural social interactions that occur at events. Second, it allows users to effortlessly and interactively discover new connections by exploring a social graph, where they can see and connect with friends of friends. Third, the POC includes functionality to bootstrap a social network starting from an empty state, gradually building up as more connections are made. Finally, it helps users find events happening around their location and provides recommendations for potentially interesting announcements based on their interests.

## Our learnings
From the development and initial user testing of the V1 POC, several insights were gained. Firstly, the QR code feature effectively facilitated genuine connections at events, demonstrating that users are likely to engage with this intuitive method. The social graph exploration feature was also well-received, with users appreciating the ability to discover layer 2 friends (friends of friends) interactively. However, bootstrapping a social network from scratch revealed the importance of critical mass; without enough initial users, the network's value diminishes. Additionally, location-based event discovery and announcement recommendations proved valuable in engaging users by aligning with their interests and activities. Overall, these features validated the core concept of enhancing social connectivity in a university setting.

## What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?
To transition from the POC to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), several essential features and improvements are needed. Most importantly, the interactions that occur after a successful connection, such as messaging and resource sharing, are missing and need to be implemented. These features are crucial for maintaining user engagement and facilitating meaningful interactions beyond the initial connection. Additionally, enhancing the user interface and experience to ensure seamless navigation and interaction within the app is necessary. More robust algorithms for personalized event and announcement recommendations would also improve user satisfaction. Implementing incentives such as earning points for activity, unlocking special badges, or participating in challenges can help bootstrap the use of the app and encourage continued engagement that is needed for a functioning MVP product.
