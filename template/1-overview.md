# Overview

## What is this project about?
UniConnect is an innovative application designed to enhance social connectivity and expand social networks for university students, both new and existing. Its core objective is to simplify and enrich the process of forming new connections and broadening one's social circle within the university environment. By addressing the unique social challenges faced by students at different stages of their academic journey, UniConnect aims to foster a more inclusive and supportive campus community.

Imagine a student who is passionate about environmental conservation and is looking to get involved in local initiatives aimed at promoting sustainability. Using UniConnect, the student can find like-minded people and join events related to environmental activism within the broader community, not limited to the university campus. The app's filtering and discovery features allow the student to identify and connect with like-minded individuals who share this interest, regardless of whether they are fellow students or members of the local community.

Through UniConnect's graph-based social network visualization, the student can see mutual connections who are also interested in environmental causes, providing a sense of familiarity and trust when reaching out. For instance, the student might notice that a friend from a different university is attending an event of a well-known local environmental organization. This insight encourages the student to engage with the organization, leveraging the mutual connection as an introduction point.

## Purpose
